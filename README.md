====================

>   A project template for [Phaser][phsr] web games.


What's included?
----------------

*   [Gulp][gulp] task manager, to handle development and distribution tasks.

*   **New in v0.6** npm script for [Audio Sprite][ausp] generation.

*   [Browserify][brsy] support for easier management of components and
    dependency tracking.

*   [BrowserSync][bsnc] development server, for cross-device testing.

*   [EditorConfig][edcf] support, for consistent editor configuration between
    collaborators â€” check if EditorConfig support is available for your code
    editor.

*   [ESLint][eslt] for code quality check.

*   [Babel][babl] to compile ECMAScript 2015 style code to compatible, ES 5.1
    syntax. Check which [language features][feat] are currently supported.

*   [Handlebars][hbs.] templates, source maps and more!


Development Instructions
------------------------

Download and extract the [packaged project][dwld] contents, or clone this
repository locally. Either way, the following npm scripts are available to you,
performing the tasks described below.

```sh
npm install   # Installs all required project dependencies.
npm start     # Launch a development server. Same as `gulp dev`.
npm run dist  # Prepare the game release for distribution. Also `gulp dist`.
npm run clean # Delete temporary and distribution build files.
```

(Optionally, you could install Gulp globally, but you are not required to do
so.)

Happy coding!
