![Phaser Plus Template](logo.png)
=================================

>   A complete project template for developing [Phaser][phsr] web games
>   including Browserify, BrowserSync and more.


Batteries Included
------------------

*   [Gulp][gulp] task manager, to handle development and distribution tasks,
    with alternative npm scripts provided.

*   [BrowserSync][bsnc] for cross-device testing.

*   [Browserify][brsy] for easier management of components and dependencies.

*   [Babel][babl] to compile ECMAScript 2015 scripts (or future specs) into
    scripts compatible with today's browsers. Check which [language
    features][feat] are currently supported.

*   [ESLint][eslt] for code quality check.

*   [EditorConfig][edcf] support, for consistent editor configuration between
    collaborators â€” check if [EditorConfig support][ecpl] is available for your
    code editor.

*   Customizable scripts for automated [Audio Sprites][ausp] generation
    (Requires [FFMpeg][ffmp]).


Development Instructions
------------------------

Download and extract the [packaged project][dwld] contents, or clone this
repository locally. Either way, the following npm scripts are available to you,
performing the tasks described below.

```sh
npm install   # Installs the required project dependencies.
npm start     # or `gulp dev`: Launches the game in development mode.
npm run dist  # or `gulp dist`: Prepares the game for distribution.
npm run clean # or `gulp dist:clean`: Deletes build files.
```

(Optionally, you could install Gulp globally, but you are not required to do
so.)
