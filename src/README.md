My Awesome (Sample) Game
===============================================================================

Hi there!

This is just a small game, to show you some of the [current capabilities][tclf]
of Traceur that may help you creating good looking, performant games. You could
use this as the foundation of your own game, or scrap the whole thing and start
coding whatever you like right away.

Now, I don't know what you'll create, neither the kind of game you want to
accomplish here. Remember, though, this project is here for you to take its
best parts from it and create your own, marvelous game. Feel free to change
anything you want.

Besides that, take some minutes to look at the source code and see the sample
game in action. I hope you find it useful.

If something is broker or not working properly, file an issue detailing the
problem you found.
